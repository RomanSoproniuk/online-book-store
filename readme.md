# Bookstore Online Application

Welcome to our Bookstore Online Application! ðŸ“–

This Java-based project aims to provide users with a seamless online shopping experience for books. Inspired by the growing trend of e-commerce and the love for literature, this application allows users to browse, purchase, and manage their book collection from the comfort of their homes.

## Technologies Used

* **Spring Boot:** For building the backend application with ease and speed.

* **Spring Boot Starter Web:** Provides essential components for building RESTful web services.

* **Spring Security:** Ensures secure authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.

* **Spring Data JPA:** Provides easy integration with the database for data persistence.

* **Swagger:** Offers a clean and interactive documentation of the API endpoints.

* **Docker:** Facilitates containerization for easy deployment and scalability.

* **Liquibase:** Manages database schema changes and versioning, ensuring smooth database migrations.

* **MySQL Database:** Relational database management system used for storing application data.

## Functionality

### Authentication and Authorization

* Users must authenticate themselves through JWT tokens to access the functionalities of the application.

* All endpoints except authentication, swagger, and errors require user authentication.

### Online Bookstore

* As an administrator, you can perform certain operations on books.

* Books are categorized for easy browsing.

* Users can add books to their cart and proceed with the purchase in the online bookstore.

### Transmission

* Data between the server and the client is transmitted using JSON format.

* REST API architecture is used for communication between the server and the client.

## Configuration

To configure the application, you can use the `.env` file.

## Setting Up the Project

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1.	Clone the repository from GitHub.
2.	Create a .env file and set the necessary variables as described above.
3.	Navigate to the project directory.
4.	Configure your Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) for database and application configuration.
5.	Run docker-compose up to build and start the containers.
6.	Liquibase will automatically handle database migrations.

## Custom Data

Users will need to substitute their custom data for the following:

`MYSQLDB_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Replace it with your MySQL root password.

`MYSQLDB_DATABASE`: Choose a name for your MySQL database.

`MYSQLDB_LOCAL_PORT`: Set a local port for your MySQL database connection.

`MYSQLDB_DOCKER_PORT`: Set a Docker port for your MySQL database connection.

`SPRING_LOCAL_PORT`: Choose a local port for your Spring Boot application.

`SPRING_DOCKER_PORT`: Choose a Docker port for your Spring Boot application.

`DEBUG_PORT`: Choose a port for debugging purposes.

`MYSQLDB_USER`: Choose a MySQL database user.

`JWT_EXPIRATION`: Set the expiration time for JWT tokens.

`JWT_SECRET`: Choose a secret key for JWT token generation and validation.

## Challenges Faced

While developing this project, we encountered several challenges:

* Implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

* Ensuring seamless integration between Spring Boot and Spring Security.

* Designing efficient database models for book categorization and user management.

* Managing database schema changes and versioning with Liquibase.
